AB Explored the relationship between self-report measures of anger and anger expression with those of social rank (unfavorable social comparison and submissive behavior) and feelings of entrapment in a student population (197 Ss, mean age 23.4 yrs). The authors further investigated if the social rank/status of the target of one's anger affects anger experience and expression. Students were given C. D. Spielberger's (1988) State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory measure of anger and asked to complete it in 3 ways. First, in the normal way, and then 2 further times after reading 2 scenarios that involved lending an important and needed book which the lender fails to return, where the lender was either an up rank/authority figure (one's tutor) or a down rank, fellow student. It was found that self-perceptions of unfavorable rank (inferior self-perceptions and submissive behavior) and feeling trapped significantly affect anger suppression. It was also found that the rank of the target significantly affects anger expression and that people who respond angrily to criticism tend to show more down rank-anger when they are frustrated by a lower rank target and modulate their anger according to the rank of the person they are angry with.
